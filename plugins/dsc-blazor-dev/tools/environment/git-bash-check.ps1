.SYNOPSIS
    Git Bash resolution self-healer (PowerShell, Windows-only) for the
    WSL-bash-stub problem.

.DESCRIPTION
    This plugin's SessionStart hooks, its MCP servers (.mcp.json), and
    the C# LSP server (.lsp.json) all invoke the bare executable "bash" to run
    their launcher scripts. On many Windows machines, "bash" resolves to the
    WSL stub at C:\Windows\System32\bash.exe (which errors out if no WSL
    distro is installed) instead of Git for Windows' real bash.exe, because
    Claude Code falls back to a plain PATH lookup for "bash" whenever its own
    Git Bash auto-detection doesn't succeed.

    This hook is deliberately PowerShell-only and never calls "bash" itself,
    so it is immune to the exact bug it's diagnosing. It locates a real Git
    Bash on this machine and, if bash currently resolves to the WSL stub (or
    to nothing), tries to RECTIFY it two ways:
      1. Writing env.CLAUDE_CODE_GIT_BASH_PATH into the user's global
         ~/.claude/settings.json - the officially supported override Claude
         Code reads to pick the right bash for hooks, MCP, and LSP command
         execution.
      2. PREPENDING Git Bash's own bin folder to the FRONT of the user's
         persistent PATH (the User-scope environment variable, via
         [Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable), so other tooling that
         shells out to a bare "bash" also finds the real one instead of the
         WSL stub - this is done regardless of whether fix #1 succeeded. It
         must be prepended, not appended: the WSL stub is typically earlier
         on PATH (e.g. System32), so appending would leave it winning the
         lookup.
    Either fix failing independently (permissions, unparsable existing
    settings.json, etc.) falls back to injecting a directive so the agent
    can warn the user and offer that specific fix manually - same Layer-2
    precondition-hook pattern as tools/bcquality/precondition_hook.ps1 and
    tools/rules/precondition_hook.ps1. Both fixes require a full Claude Code
    restart (not just a new session) to take effect, since PATH and
    settings.json env are both read at process startup.

    Idempotent: once ~/.claude/settings.json has a working path recorded and
    Git Bash's bin folder is already first on PATH, or "bash" already
    resolves correctly on PATH, this exits silently and does not touch
    anything again. No-ops silently
    on non-Windows.
